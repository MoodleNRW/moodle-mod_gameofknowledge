# Game of Knowledge

Another gamification plugin.

Game of Knowledge is a Moodle activity plugin providing a simple quiz game, but using the framework vue.js to spice up the user experience.

### Origin & Destination

The prototype for this activity was developed during the DevCamp at MoodleMoot DACH 2023 in ZÃ¼rich.  
The goal is to provide vue.js integration as a reactive frontend for Moodle plugins.  
This plugin can be used as a basis for future plugin development.

2. Copy or clone code into: `<moodledir>/mod `and name it `gameofknowledge`
3. Run the upgrade: `sudo -u user php admin/cli/upgrade` **Note:** the user may be different to user on your system.

## Usage

The activity can be inserted in any course via the activity chooser:
